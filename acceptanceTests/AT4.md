##User Story
I, as a system administrator, want to be able to reject a talk, so that the proponent edits it.

##Acceptance Test

* The system administrator accesses the dashboard.
* The system administrator rejects the proposition and chooses to give proponent the ability to edit its proposal.
* The proposer is notified via email.
